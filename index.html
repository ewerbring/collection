     <p class="n2">Collection - Carl-Gustaf Ewerbring</p>

<span class="text">
<p>During the semester we have had five separate assignments that we are now putting together into a collection of work. The assignments has been widely spread, but it has made me think and reflect about what contexts I want to work within from now on. 
<br><br>
The first assignment was called <a  href="#openModal1">Into the wild</a>, aimed to send us out to the streets to document the urban environment and highlight objects to create an urban exhibition. I chose to document variations of urban seating. To me, the most interesting part of this assignment was to decide on a subject, and then observe object as if they were created to be part of an exhibition. It made me describe them with different words, and look into detail in a way I haven't done before. 
<br><br>
It makes me think of my own practice, and the practice of many graphic designers. Many designers end up doing work that won't be considered for more than its function by a large audience. Lets say I will end up designing websites for a newspaper. Many people won't see the effort im putting into it if I'm doing a good job. As a matter of fact, they will probably most likely only notice my work if I've done a bad job. 
<br><br>
I don't know if it bothers me or not, or if it will make me pursue a career where form is more likely to be considered by a large part of the audience. But I like having it in mind and I will consider it when its time to take those choices. 
<br><br>
Going to the <a  href="#openModal2">New York Art Book Fair</a> was a natural next step with this in mind. All of a sudden I was among an audience that in this specific context almost overlooked the content or function of objects. Because of the huge amount of people visiting and work being exposed very few of us actually had energy to look deeper into the work. What caught our attention was interesting visuals. It was the complete opposite to the objects I had been looking at in my urban exhibition. And again, I don't know which one of the two extremes I'd prefer to be working in. 
<br><br>
Coming back to providence we were assigned to watch an exhibition and write a <a  href="#openModal3">reveiw</a> of it. I went to the graphic design triennial, and had a similar experience as when visiting the art book fair. All of a sudden context ant concept of the work was completely erased by not showing artist statements or work descriptions. We observed beautiful work, but had no idea what amount of process that was done to reach the final result. Since I was exhibiting my work in the exhibition I had a personal connection to it, and I felt very strongly against this. I felt it wasn't fair to us as designers.
<br><br>
The next assignment was to explore a product. The first part was to <a  href="#openModal4">write down</a> our pre assumtions and our personal experiences with the product. The second part was to <a  href="#openModal5">research</a> and present it without the help of google. Just like the urban exhibition we were forced to look closely at an object and the details of it without our standard tools. It was helpful in the way that was forced with a very limited amount of content, but limiting the amount of content made me value it in a different way than what I normally do. I watched an video describing the Bic Ballpoint pen I was researching, and I found myself listening so carefully to the information in the video and really scrutinising the informative (and funny) animations. I made a <a  target="_blank" href="https://ewerbring.github.io/nogoogle/">website</a> collecting some of the best clips.  
<br><br>
In the last assignment me and two classmates worked on something that has been close to our hearts lately, and that is bringing a bit more democracy and voices into the traditional way of planning education, so we decided to plan a <a  href="#openModal6">symposium</a>. This is not really connected to the topic of my previous assignments, but we felt it was a good opportunity to actually put words on many of the thoughts we have had recently.

<p class="n3">Response to questions from Yoon about the NY Art Book Fair
<br>Carl-Gustaf Ewerbring<p>
    <p class="n1">Who do you think is the target audience for the fair? What type of people come here? Who will enjoy the most out of these book fair? </p>

<p>
Professional graphic designers, Artsy kids of New York and hipsters. Not very many people that isn't "aware" about design and the field. It's not very welcoming for strangers, but on the other hand I don't think thats what they want either. I think they want to attract this specific, kind of difficult crowd. They don't want to go mainstream. 
<br>
<p class="n1">Books are being more and more obsolete, however there are so many people in these book fair. Why do you think that is?<p>
I think there are many factors contributing to this. One is the social context. It's a "cool place to be", and I think there is a lot of people going there just to get a good Instagram post. Then there is the networking part of it. It's a bit like the fashion week but for this specific crowd. Then there are the people actually interested in the materiality and the craft of the objects.  
<br>
<p class="n1">In you personal preference, do you value book for its contents or it’s aesthetics? Do you think art book is more valuable if the design is more sophisticated? 
<p>
When going to these events I'm mainly interested in the design of the books, secondary comes content. I think the reason is that there is no way for me to actually understand content in this quantity. I go here to find inspiration for my design. To find inspiration for my content I think I need to visit less hectic environments. 
<br>
<p class="n1">Was there a certain book or a booth that caught your attention? If so what was the reason? 
<p>
Special folds, interesting typefaces, people speaking my language (silly, I know), interesting bags to carry the items. Not so much content driven, because of what I mention in the question above. 
<br>
<p class="n1">What do you think current state of design contributes to the society or the general public in the means of form or contents?
<p>
I've been thinking of this and I do think, and I want to believe, that the general public enjoys it without being aware of it. There is nothing wrong with that they don't really know that they enjoy it as long as they do. This specific event is for those that are aware that they do enjoy it.</p>

    <p><p class="n3">Review of RISD Graphic Design Triennial 2018
<br>Carl-Gustaf Ewerbring<p>

The triennial exhibition for graphic design happens, just like the name suggests, once every third year. This means that both current undergraduate and graduate students, as well as recent graduates, can exhibit their work as long as it has been produced at RISD during those three years. Out of an exhibition perspective, this also means that there is a wide range in subjects and trends. 
<br><br>
The first thing you are being greeted by is a podium with a catalog and a few essays explaining four different subjects: Play, Prototype, Practice, Critique. It is not clear that this catalog is going to be the viewers only guide during the visit, and even if it was, it doesn't contain a lot of information. 
<br><br>
After collecting a catalog and a printed essay about the four different areas the visitor can choose to visit four different rooms. The work in these rooms consists of a wide range of different media. Books are hanging from shelves and are laying on tables for viewers to flip through. The posters are mounted on the walls and three-dimensional objects are mixed with digital media and interactive installations. There is no specific order (at least as far as I could tell) for the viewer to look at the projects. I approached all of the rooms in the same way: I read the explanation for the section, (Play, Prototype, Practice or Critique) and had that in mind as I looked through the projects. I began in the room in the far back, moved along the walls, interacted with some books at a table and continued browsing through the other rooms.
<br><br>
Seeing the explanatory text made me curious, and I just wish I somehow could find out how the projects were related to the title. But there was no way to get information about the projects. They were all display without any artist label or even the name of the person submitting the project. For me, the headlines of the room didn't make any sense anymore. Since there was no way of understanding the projects, I didn't know how they related to their subject. In one way I like the subtle way of only giving the viewer a theme for the project, but I don't think it's fair to the projects or the artists. 
<br><br>
Graphic Design is often interpreted as a shallow field and honestly, it very often is a correct assumption. In many cases, a project is just the beautiful picture without a deeper context that it is accused to be. But Rhode Island School of Design is known for its conceptual projects - meaning that they are not just pretty images created out of the blue. Many of the projects have a meaning and a fair amount of research to back them up. Projects have a purpose to ask questions, express opinions, or to create a discussion. The visual result is in many cases just the tip of an iceberg in the bigger picture. I think that it is only fair for the artist, and in the biggest interest of the viewer to communicate some of this. I think it is a huge loss not to present a more detailed context for the projects than what we get to see in the triennial. 
<br><br>
I must say, some of the projects worked better than others. In a few cases, the artist had added an explanation as part of their final result. In one interactive installation, the purpose and background were clearly described and all of a sudden the slightly pixelated and ugly alphabet got a whole new context and meaning and became, if you ask me, one of the best projects in the show. And just because this artist was lucky and had described the background in their visual presentation (as part of the screen material), it really worked. 
<br><br>
Now, If this would have been an exhibition showing a specific project and all the artists were informed that no further information than the artwork itself would be presented, it would have been a different thing. In that case, it would have been part of the challenge to make the project actually speak and communicate for itself, or not to, if that would be the intention of the artist. But now, when the projects were merely a collection of projects created in the past three years the meaning and purpose often didn't come across. 
<br><br>
The projects in the show had a natural hierarchy. Some of them got a lot of attention because they were using sound, projections or big physical models, and the curators had done a good job to balance the different pieces to give them the attention they needed. This is true for the whole exhibition except for one room, where books and posters were both hanging from wires. I couldn't tell if I was supposed to, or even allowed to take down the books to have a closer look. I feel it was needed, so I did it anyway. Since there were no labels I couldn't get any information about its content, and I can't judge a book by its cover. 
<br><br>
As in many design fields, Graphic Design isn't always considered to be a very intellectual or academic field. My notion is that this is sometimes being compensated for by writing essays, thesis reports or articles using unnecessarily difficult words and phrases. As a foreigner, I hate this. The only thing it does is to make the text harder to understand and often removes parts of the message as I drift away while reading it. What we should do is to try to communicate the intellectual concepts and processes we have in our work. By removing them, as they were in this exhibition, we are not giving our field the intellectual credibility it deserves.

<br>The BIC Ballpoint pen
<br>Carl-Gustaf Ewerbring<p>

<br>
<p class="n1">Physical/Visual<p>
<br>
The Ballpoint pen I'm looking at is from the brand BIC. It is made out of clear plastic, with a brass top and probably some different metal, maybe iron, for the actual ball that is in contact with the ink. The lid is glossy blue, made of a slightly softer and more flexible plastic than the shaft. Inside the pen, I can see the tube of ink. I can see it is almost full. This pen is not constructed to let the user change the inc tube when it is empty. 

Some ballpoint pens have a spring that lets you hide the ballpoint inside the pen when it's not in use, but this one doesn't. Instead, it comes with a cap. The cap also has the function to let the user hang it on their breast pocket or clip it onto their book or paper. This ballpoint pen doesn't have any ergonomic plastic or indications where to hold it. I think most of the metal in the pen is molded, while the plastic is probably extruded. The cap might be molded too. 
<br><br>
<p class="n1">Social/Cultural<p>
<br>
The BIC pen is very iconic. I think it is the pen most people, at least in the western parts of the world, would think of as the main model for a disposable pen. Because of the low price and the bulk pack, it is often sold in it is common to not keep very good track of them - if you would lose one you would just grab another. It is constructed to be thrown away when it is out of ink because there is  no way to refill it. 

It is a neutral object in many senses. A few years ago I heard that BIC was producing a ballpoint model for women. I didn't know what it meant at first but then realized they had introduced a product line that was identical to their original pens except for having caps in light pastel green and pink. Previously I thought of BIC as a company with a cult-vibe, that was kind of cool despite that they are creating bad products that destroy our environment by their wasteful positioning on the market - I guess I defended it as their thing and something they had done from the beginning. However, realizing their view on what is feminine and masculine made me think differently about them. All of a sudden they appear far from contemporary and I have started questioning them in ways I hadn't done before. 
<br><br>
<p class="n1">Metaphorical<p>
<br>
It is interesting to think of the BIC pen in the range of other pens. Pens can be a marker of status and wealth and have a price tag thereafter. But for some reason, I think that a BIC pen works in most contexts. I think it is because it fulfills its function very well, and that so many people see the pen as just a practical object with a very clear purpose rather than a status symbol.

Because of the low price and the accessibility (almost every home has one), there have been many alternative uses of the pen. Any time a small plastic tube is required this pen can serve. I have stumbled upon DIY guides on how to transform it into lethal weapons, creative drug equipment and tacky home decorations, and I think there are many more guides like that.

<br>The BIC Ballpoint pen
<br>Carl-Gustaf Ewerbring<p>

<br><br>
The ballpoint pen was originally invented in 1938 by a Hungarian journalist named Lazlo Biro. One of the inventions making the ballpoint pen unique was the use of the same type of ink that was used for newspaper printing. Since this ink was thicker than normal, Biro invented the rotating ball picking up ink from the cartridge and applying it to the paper. It was engineered to apply a perfect amount of ink to create a visible line that dries quickly. 
<br><br>
The ballpoint pen was used during world war two due to its capabilities to function on a high altitude. After the war, it wasn't very successful until Bich French baron named Marcel Bich bought the patent from Biro and started manufacturing his own ballpoint pens in 1950. He relaunched the invention through the Bic Cristal. France was is in its reconstruction after the war and are looking for useful and efficient consumer goods. The Bic Cristal fits the mentality well and becomes a huge success in an era when everything needed to be quickly produced to get shattered countries back up on their feet. 
<br><br>
They claim to have been inspired by crystal shapes and the honeycomb pattern found in beehives when designing the Bic Cristal. The hexagon shape is supposed to symbolize structure and strength while being ergonomic and fit the hand perfectly. But really, what they have done is to take the shape of a pencil and make it in plastic. They motivate the transparent plastic by enabling the user to see how much ink is still in the pen and to show how long the ink lasts. They claim to outrun most other pens with the Crystals capability to write up to three kilometers. But their way of explaining the design process is more likely just a piece of storytelling that they came up with in their massive advertising investments in the fifties. 
<br><br>
Bic made large investments in advertising and also invented the Bic schoolboy character. He became a character to make kids want to use their pen in their education. Bic starts selling worldwide and is now the most sold pen in the world - In 2004 more than 100 billion pens had been sold. With the first success of the ballpoint pen, the company wants to expand in the same spirit. They confirm the company spirit of only producing high-quality products to the best price by introducing the next two products: the lighter and the disposable razor. They all become icons of the throwaway area. 
<br><br>
The socialist Roberto Eco says that the Bic Crystal is a unique example of achieved socialism since it is doing away with all ownership rights and social distinctions. He argues that the pen is such a functional product that is not tied to class. This however for some reason doesn't apply to the razor and the lighter. Personally, I do agree with this, but the theory met some resistance while interviewing, or rather trying to interview the staff at Dick Blick art supplies in Providence. When asking for the Bic Crystal the employee I talked to said I would have to go to Staples or something to find that because Dick Blick doesn't carry them in stock.  
<br><br>
While talking to Peter Lundqvist, manager of Pen store located on Södermalm in Stockholm, Sweden, he said that the Bic Cristal will be what defines our age of disposable products – he calls it the age of stupid. "How can we value to buy so huge quantities instead of quality in our products? It's not profitable to sell these as single pens, I only carry them in packs of ten. And they go for the same price as one pen of slightly higher quality. But I guess people value to be able to be lazy and not keep track of their pens. I think the Bic Cristal is going to be the arrowhead of the future – archeologists are going to find them pretty much everywhere."

    <p><p class="n3">Design/Proposal/Product
<br>Future Syllabus
<br>Calle, Maddie and Georgie<p><br>

<p class="n2">BRIEF<p>
Throughout discussions this semester, there have been many debates surrounding the aims, methods
and value of existing systems in design education. As a way to address these questions and expand the
discourse within the industry as a whole, we are proposing a biannual design education symposium.
<br><br>
<p class="n2">OVERVIEW<p>
This symposium will take place over three days—Friday to Sunday—and invite current students,
professors, program directors, young and experienced professionals and self-taught designers to be
involved.
<br><br>
There will be group panel discussions, individual speakers and workshops. The talks will focus on topics
relating to design education, such as: design critique as a pedagogic tool, the future of design and
technology, formal design training vs. experimental approaches, mentorship and education outside of the
university in the professional world.
<br><br>
The event will run every two years and should reflect the important conversations surrounding design and
its teaching at that time. Each year, the topics will reflect the most urgent discussions and give a platform
to the most relevant critics and designers. The workshops will work to support the discussions with a
specific focus around critique and mentorship.
<br><br>
The aim is to have the event be as accessible and low cost as possible. To achieve this, the symposium
will take place at institutions of higher education. In exchange for volunteering their spaces, this will
provide schools with a platform to promote their own programs and become involved in the community we
are developing. However, in order to be approved to host the event, schools must undergo a certification
process, wherein they must provide evidence that they are taking the initiative to adjust their curriculum
according to the outcomes and recommendations of the previous year’s symposium.
<br><br>
By bringing together this multitude of perspectives, we hope to reflect what is happening in the industry
and be able to improve education practices in design pedagogy.
<br><br>
<p class="n2">KEY COMPONENTS<p>
● Panel discussions<br>
● Individual speakers<br>
● Workshops<br>
● Mentorship Program: This will include pairings of both students seeking guidance from
professionals and educators, as well as educators seeking feedback and guidance from students.<br>
● “Report Card”: Following each symposium, we will compile and publish a guidebook, highlighting
the most urgent discussions and distilling them into concrete recommendations that schools can
act upon. These recommendations will form the basis of our certification system which
determines the host of subsequent symposiums.<br>
● “Report Card”: Following each symposium, we will compile and publish a guidebook, highlighting
Tone of voice: It is important to the success of the event that its inclusive to people both
in and outside the world of academia. The language used should be considerate of the
wider design community and should not come across as intimidating.<br><br>
<p class="n2">VISUAL REFERENCE – A “DEMOCRATIC” LOOK<p>
We are trying to change old structures in education, so we want the visuals to represent hackability and to
encourage modification. We are choosing cheap materials and methods.<br><br>
The schedule is available through Google Docs, so that all visitors can use their own schedule to take
notes from talks, workshops and conversations. Throughout the event low-tech printers are placed so that
the visitors can print their notes whenever they want.<br><br>
By the end of the symposium, users are asked if they would like to anonymously share any parts of their
notes to a visitors feedback book. This is meant to be a critical and transparent way to review the event
itself. The notes will be put together to a saddle stitched pamphlet and can be sent out to anyone who
asks for it. Neon and fluorescent colors will be used as guidance and communication.
